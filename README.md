# Time-Series Forecasting

## Overview
Comparing classic econometric ARIMA models with modern Random-Forest machine learning algorithms 
regarding the computation of out-of-sample time-series forecasts on different macroeconomic indicators like GDP. 
For now, only GDP growth is included in this analysis. The data is split into training, validation and test sets, whereas the training set is used for model training and the validation set is used for finding the best hyperparameters for each algorithm. The test data is used for computation of out-of-sample forecasts and model evaluation. 

## To-Do
- Fine tuning ARIMA forecasts
- Implementation of Random-Forest algorithm
