# Time-Series Forecasting

## Overview
Comparing classic econometric forecasting models like autoregressive-integrated-moving-average (ARIMA) and vector-autoregression (VAR) with modern RandomForest machine learning algorithms regarding the computation of time-series forecasts on the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). In the first part of this analysis, a general overview of the data is given consisting of different visualizations and hypothesis tests in regards of the order of differencing required to make the data stationary and the autocorrelation of the data. Furthermore, the data is split into three subsets: training, validation and testing. Whereas the training data is used for model training, the validation set is used for hyperparameter optimization and the test set is used for final evaluation and out-of-sample forecasting. The following parts consist of the different models mentioned above.
